k8s docs -> ingress -> simple fanout

In order for an Ingress to work in your cluster, there must be an ingress controller running. You need to select at least one ingress controller and make sure it is set up in your cluster. 

```yaml

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: world
  namespace: world
  annotations:
    # this annotation removes the need for a trailing slash when calling urls
    # but it is not necessary for solving this scenario
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx # k get ingressclass
  rules:
  - host: "world.universe.mine"
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /europe
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: europe
            port:
              number: 80
      - path: /asia
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: asia
            port:
              number: 80
```
